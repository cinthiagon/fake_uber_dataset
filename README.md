# FAKE UBER TRIPS DATASET ðŸš˜

This repository contains two Python scripts that generate synthetic datasets for various analytical purposes. These datasets can be used for data analysis, machine learning, and other forms of analytics. You can see an example [here](https://public.tableau.com/shared/HZC9N5CYS?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link). Disclaimer: the scripts leverage the Faker and Random libraries to create **realistic, yet fictional** data.


## Scripts

#### 1. Uber Trips Dataset Generator: 
This script generates a fake dataset of Uber trips between 10 different locations. It uses the Faker and Random libraries to create realistic trip data, including information such as trip start and end times, trip durations, distances, and more.

- Libraries Used: Pandas, Faker, Random
- Output Formats: CSV, XLSX.

#### 2. Police Incidents Simulator:
This script simulates police incidents occurring in one of the specified locations. It also uses the Faker and Random libraries to create plausible incident reports, including details such as the type of incident, the time it occurred, and the location.

- Libraries Used: Pandas, Faker, Random
- Output Formats: CSV, XLSX.
